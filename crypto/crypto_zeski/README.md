## Description

One of my friends is really into crypto. Not the "spend a years salary on funny monkey picture"-kind, the math thingy. He sent me a super strange text, can you help me decipher it? He said it's so easy, even people just carrying sticks and stones around would be able to decipher it.

## Solution

Included in the generator.py file.

Its a scytale cipher with an offset of 30 and steps of 100 between.
