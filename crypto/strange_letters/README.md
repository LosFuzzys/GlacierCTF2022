## Description

MY friend is annoying me again. He sent me another strange picture and wants me to find it funny. He thinks it's cool making fun of me, just becuase i became a monk after school.

## Solution

Numbers are written using the cisterian monks numeral system. After you have the numbers just convert to hex and then to ascii to get the flag.
