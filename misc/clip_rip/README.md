## Description

  I wrote my own clipboard manager. It is very secure and that allows me to expose it to the internet without any risks.
  My only problem is, that I have to copy the passwords with my passwordmanagers copy function.
  Otherwise I cannot distinguish between passwords and text and the passwords will get stored normally.
  I try not to forgett that...

## Solution

1. parse the `list` output of the challenge
2. `restore` an entry, that is the same as the current entry (This truncates the list)
3. repeate until you get thae flag.
