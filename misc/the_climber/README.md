## Description

Last year i finally got to climb my first glacier. Look at how pretty my picture is.

## Solution

Step1: binwalk on the file, extract the jpg
Step2: The 2nd file has the flag written on it. You need to diff it with the orighinal found using image search to see the difference.

flag = glacierctf{It'5_fUck1ng_C0ld_uP_h3r3}
